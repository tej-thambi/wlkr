            <p>
                wlkr is a startup created by five like-minded entrepreneurs. our team has worked tirelessly over the course of 10 weeks, 
                during a UCLA incubator, to build wlkr. <br>
                we worked through an ideation process, a customer and market research process, a development process,
                and created a comprehensive pitch deck. <br>
                our hard work culminated during a Demo Day, when we pitched our product to a panel of successful startup founders.
