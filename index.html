        pet sitting for <b>every</b> pet

        <h2>the problem</h2>
        <p>
            pet owners face a variety of issues when searching for pet care in any capacity, 
            either during a work shift, work trip, or vacation. 
            for example, finding consistent pet care that provides pets with a routine, 
            or finding trustworthy and qualified pet sitters. 
            these issues are amplified for owners with non-traditional pets, like lizards, birds, or insects. 
            while similar platforms exist, none cater to exotic pets like wlkr plans to. 
        </p>
        <h2>the wlkr solution</h2>
        <p>
            the wlkr app connects pet owners in need of pet care with qualified pet sitters in their area.

        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>
            wlkr is a startup developed in the BruinLabs startup program at UCLA. 
            our team worked over the course of 10 weeks to build wlkr. 
            we worked through an ideation process, a customer and market research process, 
            an MVP development process, and a pitching process. 
            this culminated in a demo day where we pitched our product to fellow participants 
            along with successful startup founders and received feedback.
