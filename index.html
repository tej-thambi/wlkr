            <h2>the problem</h2>
            <p>
                pet owners face a variety of issues when searching for pet care in any capacity, 
                either during a work shift, work trip, or vacation.<br> 
                for example, finding consistent pet care that provides pets with a routine, 
                or finding trustworthy and qualified pet sitters. <br>
                these issues are amplified for owners with non-traditional pets, like lizards, birds, or insects. <br>
                while similar platforms exist, none cater to exotic pets like wlkr plans to.

            <p>
                wlkr is a startup developed in the BruinLabs startup program at UCLA. 
                our team worked over the course of 10 weeks to build wlkr. <br>
                we worked through an ideation process, a customer and market research process, 
                an MVP development process, and a pitching process. <br>
                this culminated in a demo day where we pitched our product to fellow participants 
                along with successful startup founders and received feedback.
