            <h2>the problem</h2>
            <p>
                Trustworthy petcare is few and far between, and it’s hard to find petcare in any capacity.
                Whether you work long shifts or you take long vacations, the need for petcare is almost inevitable. 
                Pets are our loved ones, our closest companions; they’re family. 
                The care they require must reach a certain standard, and this standard has to be consistent. 
                These issues are amplified for owners with non-traditional pets, like lizards, birds, or insects. 
                While similar platforms may exist, none cater to pets, especially exotic ones, like wlkr plans to. 
                Being a pet owner is difficult enough, and wlkr is here to help.

            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>
                wlkr is a startup created by five like-minded entrepreneurs. 
                Our team has worked tirelessly over the course of 10 weeks, during a UCLA incubator, to build wlkr. 
                We worked through an ideation process, completed comprehensive customer and market research, 
                forged through the development phase, and then created a pitch deck. 
                Our hard work culminated during a presentation of our product to a panel of successful startup founders. 
                We are extremely proud of our progress, and even more excited to bring wlkr to users around the world.
