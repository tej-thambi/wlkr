                <h2>how do we verify petsitters?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We understand that the people who take care of your pets must be experienced and trustworthy. <br>
                    This is a process we are still workshopping, but we plan on interviewing each candidate, <br>
                    vetting them before they can become a verified sitter. We will also have badges that indicate <br>
                    sitters have prior experience with a specific type of animal, whether it be as a previous owner <br>
                    or in some other capacity. Additionally, our review system will help showcase past performance <br>
                    and help build trust within our community.

                <h2>what kinds of animals does wlkr cover?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If it exists, then wlkr most likely covers it. More traditional pets like cats and dogs are <br>
                    covered. We also provide sitters/specialists for more exotic pets. If your pet isn't covered <br>
                    in our system, you will have the option to make a special request to add it. We are here to <br>
                    provide our clients with the best possible petcare, regardless of what that pet is, or what that <br>
                    care may look like. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>how will price be calculated?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Here at wlkr we understand how stressful petcare can be. To help alleviate some of that stress <br>
                    we are experimenting with an affordable pay system. The exact numbers of our pricing is still in <br>
                    the works. There will be a base fee and a per day fee, with add-ons for special requests and exotic animals. <br>
                    Tip will be at the discretion of the pet owner based on exceptional performance. wlkr will only take <br>
                    a small portion of the base fee, ensuring payment reaches the sitters who are working hard for your pets. <br>
                    A full plan for our compensation system will be released at a later date.

                    Just reach out to us on any of our socials, call us, or e-mail us. Our Contact Us page should have all <br>
                    the information you need. After your initial message, we will get back to you within 1-3 business days <br>
                    Then we will initiate the interview process and look into your background with animals. If everything <br>
                    checks out, then you can create your profile and begin accepting jobs!

                <br>
                <p>
                    During the interview process, you can demonstrate your experience with certain animals. For example <br>
                    if you have worked with snakes in some capacity, you can provide us with proof or a reference, and <br>
                    we will add this badge to your profile. If you still want to add badges after the interview process, <br>
                    you can apply for a badge on the website with evidence or a reference. We will review your application <br>
                    and add the new badge to your profile. The more badges the better!
